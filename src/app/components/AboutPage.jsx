          <p><b>Personal:</b>
            I&#39;m (almost) a Florida native, having moved from the midwest just after High school and completing my BS Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University.
            I love the Ocean and am an avid Kayaker, as well as Scuba Diver - helping lead a local dive club called <a href="http://www.kayuba.org"><b>Kayuba</b></a>.
            My other interests include 3D modeling/rendering, Augmented, Virtual and Mixed reality development, motorcycling, playing guitar, and traveling.

        <div className="groupedText">
          <p><b>Currently:</b>
            I&#39;m very engaged in both Virtual Reality, as well as Voice computing. Using Oculus Rift/Unity3D, I created the first VR demos for American Express to demonstrate use cases in eLearning as well as virtual Architecture (building) walkthroughs.
              I&#39;m proud to be one of the first (1000) Amazon &quot;Alexa&quot; skill developers, having developed <b>&quot;The Music Man&quot;</b> for Amazon Echo customers. &quot;The Music Man&quot; is written in Java, hosted in AWS/Lambda, and leverages a third party &quot;Songkick&quot; API to allow users to query where their favorite musical
              artists are playing next, or the calendar of events coming to a local venue.
